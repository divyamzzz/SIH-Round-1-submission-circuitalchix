## Project Description
Weâ€™ve built a web application designed to empower patients by providing them with the ability to upload their lab tests details, X-ray scans, and other medical records for disease prediction using advanced machine learning algorithms. The app will analyze these inputs to offer quick and accurate predictions, helping users understand potential health risks and conditions.
 By leveraging cutting-edge technology, the app aims to aid in early diagnosis, offering personalized health insights and improving patient outcomes. Additionally, it will serve as a convenient platform for users to track their health data and receive timely recommendations for medical consultation.
